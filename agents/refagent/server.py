"""refagent inside AgentCore Runtime: the two endpoints the runtime calls.

`POST /invocations` takes `{"question": "..."}` and returns the raw
observation `agent.answer` writes — the same shape the runner writes on a
PR, so the envelope does not change when the subject moves from the runner
to the deployed runtime (ruling l). `GET /ping` is the health check.

The runtime reads the rights table from DynamoDB
(`AGENTKEEL_RIGHTS_TABLE`, set by `GovernedAgent`), through the VPC's
gateway endpoint. There is no way out of that VPC (ADR-0006), so if the
variable is not set the answer is an error that says so; it does not fall
back to the file, which is not in the image (`agent.rights_rows` would try
it, so the server does not call it without a table).

The model is `AGENTKEEL_MODEL_PROFILE`, the profile `GovernedAgent` makes
from the manifest's pin, and nothing else: with no default, a runtime
started without it answers with an error rather than call a model the pin
does not name (M04 PR 2; M04 open.md row 22, item f).

From M05 PR 2 (SPEC/05 §2, §5, seed S4's reader) a request may carry `chain`,
the agents that called before this one, in order; the chain's depth is its
length plus one. A chain deeper than `AGENTKEEL_CEILING_DEPTH` (the manifest's
`ceilings.depth`, which `GovernedAgent` sets: the image has no YAML reader) is
refused **before any model call or table read**, and the refusal is written
as an event under the agent's own prefix in the security account's audit
bucket (`AGENTKEEL_AUDIT_BUCKET`, `AGENTKEEL_AUDIT_PREFIX`), with the call's
session id so the trail's record of the call can be matched to it. A runtime
with no ceiling set refuses every call rather than hold a chain to nothing.
The chain is what the caller asserts; that a caller cannot lie about it is
Identity's, at M07 (SPEC/05 §5). That the call was refused rests on this
event and on no model call by the role (self-reported, SPEC/05 §2).

This server judges nothing and writes no envelope (P5).
